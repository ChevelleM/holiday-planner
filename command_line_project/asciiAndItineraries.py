kohsamui_adventure = """\n
I would say go for a boat tour around the Mu Ko AngThong National Marine Park - one of the most beautiful natural wonders of Thailand. It will take you to Koh Mae Ko island where you can hike up to a viewpoint to see the beautiful and famous Emerald Lake. The boat tour will then take you to Wua Ta Lap Island where you can hike up a 500m hill to the Pha Jun Jaras viewpoint to see the breathtaking view of the Gulf of Thailand. After getting back to the main island, you can reward yourself with some really tasty authentic Thai food at Ma Lee restaurant (Be sure to order the banana fritters - they are the best!). 

"""

kohsamui_culture = """\n
I would say hire a taxi for the day to do some sightseeing around the whole island. Notable attractions include Na Muang Waterfall, Big Buddha Temple and Central Festival. In the evening, you can then go to the Fisherman's village to explore the night market which offers many cheap clothing, food and souvenirs. There is also a really cool open air beach bar called Coco Tam's where you can chill on bean bags on the beach and watch a very impressive free fire show at night - definitely a must-see! 

"""

kohsamui_relax = """\n
I would say spend the whole day chilling at Lai Mai beach and visiting a restaurant called The Cocoon - a hilltop viewpoint restaurant with amazing interior and food. Alternatively, you can take a ferry to Koh Madsum (otherwise famously known as Pig island) to chill with the pigs and do some snorkelling nearby at Koh Tao.

"""

london_adventure = """\n
I would say explore Camden market, famous for its street food markets, clothes and crafts stalls. Another option is to explore the graffiti art and visit Brick lane market in Shoreditch. There, you can find many hipster brunch places, rooftop bars and Box park for lunch. Alternatvely, you can climb the roof of the O2 arena ot get a 360 degree view of the capital. If you are visiting south of London, you could spend a day at Gravity in Wandsworth where you can do go-karting, play mini golf, go bowling and play VR and arcade games all under one roof!

"""

london_culture = """\n
I would say start the day in Victoria to see the infamous Buckingham Palace. Then take a 15 minute walk to Westminister to capure the sights of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. You can then walk towards Waterloo along the Thames to see the London Eye. After, head over to Trafalgar Square to see Nelson's column, where you can then walk to Picadilly and Leicester Square to get some delicious dim sum in Chinatown. In the evening, you can do some late night shopping at Oxford Street or visit the bars in Soho. My personal favourite is NQ64 arcade bar where you can play arcade games, get game-themed cocktails, listen to great RnB music and enjoy the bright fluorescent interior. 

"""

london_relax = """\n
I would say go to Greenwich park to see the breathtaking views of the London skyline and walk under the pretty cherry blossom trees. You can also see the Royal Observatory and the marker of the Meridian Line which famously splits the Earth into East and West. After, you can also explore Greenwich Market which has a range of stall of craft, food and drink. Nearby, you can also visit the very impressive looking Cutty Sark. 

"""

malta_adventure = """\n
I would say get the ferry to explore the island of Comino island where you can see the Blue Lagoon bay with its crystal clear and azure-coloured water and do some snorkelling. You can then get the ferry to Gozo and explore Citadella - a small fortified town on a hill overlooking the capital town of Victoria. You can also take a bus to see the Xwejni salt pans, which is great for photos. Alternatively, you can go to Zurrieq to see the Blue Grotto, to tour around the beautiful hidden caves with glowing waters.

"""

malta_culture = """\n
I would say explore the streets of Valetta, see the Tritons Fountains and check out the cool shops, bars and restaurants on Republic Street. You can go to the Upper Barrakka gardens to enjoy the sublime views of the harbor and the waterfront whilst admiring the Mediterranean gardens. There is also a saluting battery there too if you would like to hear some canons being fired. After, you can roam around the streets of Mdina by entering through Mdina Gate. It is known as Malta’s Silent City, as well as being famous for Malta's Game of Thrones filming locations.

"""

malta_relax = """\n
I would say go to Marsaxlokk fishing village for the peaceful walks around the harbour, admire the views of the colourful boats, explore the fish market and to try one of the finest fish restauarants on the island. Alternatively, you can also go to Dingli cliffs - the highest point of Malta with an amazing view of where the sky and the sea meet which makes it a great place for a nice peaceful walk.

"""

menorca_adventure = """\n
I would say take a hike up to El Toro, known as the tallest hill of the island of Menorca, to see a 360 degree breathtaking view of Menorca. After, you can go glass kayaking in Binibeca and then roam around the famous model fishing village in Binebeca made up of white buildings. In the evening, you can go to a cave bar called Covo d'en Xoroi which is situated on the cliffs to watch the sunset. 

"""

menorca_culture = """\n
I would say explore the beautiful streets of the old town Ciutedella, do some shopping at the markets and visit the port. A great brunch place is Nibs Healthy Bar where you can eat some yummy pancakes or deliciously fresh acai bowl with amazing coffee. If you have a bit more to splurge, you can go to Ivette Beach Club where you can have lunch on a cliff whilst enjoying the amazing views of Cala Morell. In the evening, head over to Port d'en Gil to watch the sunset. 

"""

menorca_relax = """\n
I would say go to Cala Macarelleta - the water is turquoise crystal clear with white sand and there are beautiful views from the limestone cliff trail. It is also worth visiting Cala Galdana which is one of the biggest calas on the island with lots of restaurants, shops and resorts. You can grab lunch or dinner at El Mirador for an amazing seafront view and delicious paella.

"""

milan_adventure = """\n
I would say get a train to Lake Como (Como San Giovanni station) which only takes 40 minutes from Milano Centrale. Then get a ferry from Como San Giovanni to Bellagio where you can wonder around on the cobbled streets, admire the beautiful lake view and explore the small local shops. After, you can get a ferry to Varenna to walk around the lovely botanical gardens, eat amazing gelato and watch the picturesque sunset.

"""

milan_culture = """\n
I would say first visit the infamous Duomo and its rooftop terrace to admire the outstanding architecture in its entirety. Next to the Duomo, is il Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, where you can do some shopping at luxury boutiques or eat at high quality restaurants (or just to explore the building if you are on a budget!). You can also go to the Starbucks Reserve Milano Roastery - the most beautiful Starbucks in the world, which serves a huge variety of unique coffee blends. After you can head over to the Brera district, the artists' quarter, for street food, countless ateliers, shops and artisan spaces. If you are a huge football fan and an even bigger A.C. and Inter Milan fan, you may also would like to take a visit to San Siro stadium.

"""

milan_relax = """\n
I would say explore the historical grounds of Castello Sforzesco and then walk around Parco Sempione which is one of the largest parks in Milan, to enjoy the lovely italian weather. Here, you will also see Arco della Pace. In the evening, you can have dinner alongside the canal at il Navigli district, as well as take a stroll alongside the waterfront.
